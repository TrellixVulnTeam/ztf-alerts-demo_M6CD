    "- Set up `Docker`\n",
    "- Using `Docker`, deploy a `MongoDB` database, fetch a night worth of (pre-filtered to reduce size) public ZTF alerts, ingest it into the database, and create indices in the database for faster queries\n",
    "- Set up `Robo3T` and use it to look at the database and query it\n",
    "- Query the database using `python`\n",
    "- Inspect the contents of an alert packet\n",
    "- Construct and plot a light curve\n",

The script will add a `coordinates` field to each that is not part of the original alert packets, to allow 2d indexation on the sphere for fast positional/cone searches."
